10/10 update: I was able to remove the base href tag from the head and add a .nojekyll file, and the site still seems to work on GitHub pages. Found the recomendation  from this [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/d703bn/can_i_create_a_github_pages_website_without_using/).

## Week 9 and Week 10
I have created a reading list. I already had the json file of all the recent books I read from a different project, but all html/css/javascript code is all new code written for these exercises. Since I coded this before we were taught how to load json, I have coded it similar to how I have coded previous projects that read from a json file.

All exercises are in the week_9-week_10 folder.

## Week 11
All exercises are in the week_11 folder. I tried to use the same methods of loading the json and error handling that we learned in class.
