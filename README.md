# cs424ClassExercises

I have decieded to make the website for the fictional Greendale Community College from the TV show Community.

I am also using Github pages to host the site, which you can [View here](https://ryan-montville.github.io/cs424ClassExercises/).

10/10 update: I was able to remove the base href tag from the head and add a .nojekyll file, and the site still seems to work on GitHub pages. Found the recomendation  from this [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/d703bn/can_i_create_a_github_pages_website_without_using/).
