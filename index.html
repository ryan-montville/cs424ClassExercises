            school which has over 80 different fields of study. The current Dean is Craig Pelton and its mascot is the
            "Greendale Human Being". <span class="reference-link">[<a href="#community-wiki">1</a>]</span></p>

        <section id="history">
            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>The land upon which Greendale Community College would eventually be built was originally the site of an
                animal rendering plant [1]. In 1974, inventor Russell Borchert purchased the grounds and founded a
                technological institute known as the "Greendale Computery College". The school's first head
                administrator was Dean Pizzini who had to deal with a scandal the following year that almost shut down
                the college. This involved Borchert and his unnatural love for his computer science experiment. Borchert
                was believed to have died from a "computer virus" so Dean Pizzini sealed off Borchert's computer lab in
                case an actual contagion was involved. The city purchased the campus in the aftermath turning it into a
                traditional community college.</p>
            <p>In 1977 the school finally got a roof and two years later in 1979 the Air Conditioning Repair school was
                established. The following decade in 1983 a student protest was held over the school's racially
                insensitive mascot at the time "Big Chief Drunky". In response the mascot would be renamed the "Sober
                Casinoman" only to be changed again sometime later to the "Greendale Grizzlies". In the 1990's Dean
                Bigley was in charge and his administration saw General Manuel Noriega being granted an honorary degree.
                During this time a memorable Greendale television commercial was filmed which would be used for nearly
                two decades.</p>
            <p>The current administration under Dean Craig Pelton instituted several incentive programs to improve
                enrollment. A new mascot was created to represent a diverse student body called the "Greendale Human
                Being". The school logo was also changed in 2010 to a symbol representing the school as a crossroads.
                The long running commercial was finally updated with an appearance by character actor Luis Guzman who
                was an alumnus of the school. In 2013 Greendale was sued by a former graduate for not educating him
                properly and a grading scandal rocked the campus. Pelton put together a special committee that restored
                harmony and improved campus life. <span class="reference-link">[<a href="history">3</a>]</span></p>
